      'The overarching goal of this project is to confirm or refute the role of passive immunization as a safe and efficacious therapy in preventing the progression from mild to severe/critical COVID-19 illness and to understand the immunologic kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after passive immunization.The primary objective is to determine the efficacy and safety of a single dose of convalescent plasma (CP) for preventing the progression from mild to severe COVID-19 illness. The secondary objective is to characterize the immunologic response to CP administration.',
